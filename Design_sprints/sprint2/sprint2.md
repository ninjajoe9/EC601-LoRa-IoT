# Sprint 2

## Goals

- Establish LoRaWAN Gateway
- Connect 2 ESP32 Nodes with GPIO Pins
  - Solder Headder pins and Wire ESP32 boards with LED on one board and momentary switch on other
  - Write Arduino Code to push to ESP32 to have them communicate
  - Test ESP32 Boards Locally
- Test Distance of ESP32 Boards in Urban Environment

## Results

- LoRa Gateway established

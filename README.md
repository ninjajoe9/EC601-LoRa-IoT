# LoRaPins
An Arduino/Python Library for controlling the GPIO pins of multiple microcontroller devices over LoRa communication protocol

## Why LoRa?

![LoRa Logo](https://github.com/ninjajoe9/EC601-LoRa-IoT/blob/main/resources/LoRa-logo.png)

LoRa (short for long range) is a spread spectrum modulation technique derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology. LoRa is a long range, low power wireless platform that enable users to construct a robust wireless platform of Internet of Things.
The main benefits of LoRa are long-range, low-power and low-cost connectivity. Compared to other protocol such as Cellular protocols or the WiFi protocol, LoRaâ€™s range and power consumption advantage has give LoRa capability to construct a larger, cheaper IoT network.

## What LoRaPins does for you

LoRaPins is a library that abstracts away the details of the LoRa protocol so you only need to worry about the inputs and outputs of the sensors and actuators on the various devices in your network. After implementing LoRaPins, you can treat the pins on a node multiple kilometers away as if they are on the same device directly in front of you. While we absolutely endorse you learn more about the LoRa protocol, you wont have to get bogged down in the details of how LoRa works, or how to format the packets to get your devices to communicate. 

### What LoRaPins is Not - Understanding the limitations of LoRa

As mentioned above, LoRa is different from Bluetooth and WiFi in that you can communicate at much longer distances and significantly reduced power but at the cost of bandwidth. Do not expect LoRa to allow full video or voice communication, or large amounts of data retrieval. LoRa is ideal for IoT devices where one node needs to know the status of a particular sensor on another node, or send a short message between two users who both have a LoRa Device.

Currently LoRa Pins is only implemented on the [Heltec32 LoRa 32 v2](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32/) development board, and only for local mesh networks (i.e. not over the internet via LoRaWAN). While we intend to expand development to additional board types (starting with the [Adafruit RaspberryPi Zero Bonnet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4074?gclid=CjwKCAiAtdGNBhAmEiwAWxGcUozS6muD0NSz0A3r0Cih3FSe6jchsEw7G5WLAznO3jkp0htGQKD3PxoCMYoQAvD_BwE)) and additional code formats (python libraries) as well as implementing LoRaWAN protocols to enable Mesh to Mesh communication over the internet, we have not done so yet. This project primarily served as a proof of concept for a graduate engineering class at Boston University so future development will likely be slow. (Please see contact information below if you're interested in developing additional packages or assisting in this project!)   



## Quick setup guide - A digital implementation of LoRa LED "Pagers"

This is an example of how to use this library to build a mesh of 'pagers' to demonstrate the most basic functionality of the LoRaPins libarary. It allows the user to configure 2 or more Nodes that will recieve a broadcast from any other Node and cause a LED to blink on all the other nodes. Further implementation of addressing and use of multiple pins can be expanded form here, and soon a 'configuration wizard' will be complete to allow for automatic addressing and pin configuration on all nodes. Additionally an example sketch exists [here](https://github.com/ninjajoe9/EC601-LoRa-IoT/blob/main/SourceCode/Examples/pin_status_send_rec_servo/pin_status_send_rec_servo.ino) to use analog values from 0-255 instead of digital on/off values in this implementation for use with analog devices.  

As mentioned above, LoRaPins is currectly only implemented for Heltec ESP32 LoRa development boards, however use on other boards could be easily implemented by using the `#include "lora.h"` instead of `#include "heltec.h"` at the beginning of your library. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions with this method. 

**Step 1: Add LoRaPins library to your Arduino Library**

Follow [THIS](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries) guide using the 'Manual Installation' instructions to add the folder LoRaPins to your arduino 'libraries' folder. 

**Step 2: Configure Heltec boards**

Use this wiring diagram to attach and LED and a momentary push button to all Nodes in your network. 

(*WARNING:* ENSURE YOU ATTACH THE ANTENNA to the u.FL connector before powering on the board. Failure to do so can cause damage to the board and may result in inability to use for LoRa radio communication.)

**Step 3: Program Boards**

Ensure you have the Heltec ESP32 LoRa Boards imported to your board manager in Ardunio IDE following [this](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp32+arduino/quick_start.html) guide. 

Download and push the basic [pin_status_from_lib.ino](https://github.com/ninjajoe9/EC601-LoRa-IoT/blob/main/SourceCode/Examples/pin_status_from_lib/pin_status_from_lib.ino) sketch to each board using the arduino IDE. (for best practice, change line 15 of each board `String thisNode = String("Node2");` to give each node a unique name. While failing to do so will not break the code, it will lead to some confusion if you are using serial monitoring to view signal output betwen boards if they are all named the same thing)

**Step 4: Attach power and test nodes**

Connect each board to a power source and test the nodes by pressing a button on any one node. the LEDs of the corisponding Nodes should illuminate.

**Step 5: Congrats! Tinker from here!**

If your LoRa pagers work, Great! Feel free to modify the libraries and enhance their capabilities. 


Troublshooting: 

- Double check your wiring and pin configuration. If you're not using the same pins as in the diagram, make sure you modify the pins in the code as well. (*WARNING:*  Not all pins on the Heltec ESP32 LoRa board are availible for use like a regular ESP32 microcontroler, as some are predesignated for OLED display and LoRa function.) 

- If you are unable to get the LoRaPins library implemented in to your Arduino Library, try pushing the manually implemented version of the code found [here](https://github.com/ninjajoe9/EC601-LoRa-IoT/blob/main/SourceCode/Examples/pin_status_send_rec/pin_status_send_rec.ino). Then you can just use the embedded functions to handle the LoRa Strings for you. 

- If you are unable to boot to the board and you are stuck in a communication loop `...---...---`, and you're using Analog devices like a potentiometer, ensure the potentiometer isn't causing undue resistance on your circuit during booting and turn the resistance all the way down. 

These are just a few probelms we ran into that were difficult to troubleshoot when we were developing this library. If you need help, please create an issue and we'll endevor to fix it. If enough people have similar issues we'll add them to the troublshooting list, so getting your own help will help others! 

## Future plans/implementation goals
- Adding the functionalities to implement communication through the LoRaWAN Gateway from the local mesh network to another mesh network.
- Creating a simple User Interface that takes in details of the number of GPIO pins required for an application and converts it into a JSON format which can be used by the software package to assign GPIO pins accordingly.
- Make the package more robust such that 'n' number of GPIO pins can be implemented.
